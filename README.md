# InsuranceFraudDetection
This project identifies fraudulent car insurance claims in R.
The dataset consists of 15,430 claims; each claim comprises 33 attributes. 

This project was challenging since the dataset was highly imbalanced and contains missing data.
I have created random forest and logistic regression models in R to identify the fraudulent claims and used feature selection, 10-fold cross validation and upsampling techniques to overcome the data imbalance to improve model accuracy.

1) capstone.Rproj is the R project file
2) claims.csv is the dataset
3) insurance_fraud1.Rmd is the R notebook
4) LeenaHDamle_ch2879_Capstone_Report.pdf is the project report which summarizes the project, steps of analysis, results at each step and conclusion.
